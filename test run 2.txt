Extended Information for Mexican Red Knee Tarantula:
Terrarium Setup: Provide a terrarium of at least 5-10 gallons with a secure lid; these tarantulas are ground dwellers and need horizontal space.
Substrate: Use a thick layer of substrate like coconut fiber or peat moss for burrowing; keep it slightly moist but not wet.
Temperature and Humidity: Maintain a temperature between 75-85Â°F and humidity levels around 60-70% for optimal health.
Hiding Places: Offer hiding spots using bark, hollow logs, or terracotta pots to mimic their natural habitat.
Feeding: Feed them live prey such as crickets or mealworms; juveniles eat more frequently than adults, typically once or twice a week.
Water Source: Provide a shallow water dish for drinking; ensure it's not too deep to prevent drowning.
Handling: Limit handling as tarantulas can become stressed; they are also fragile and prone to injury from falls.
Molting Process: Recognize the molting process, during which they should not be fed or disturbed, as they are vulnerable.
Regular Maintenance: Clean the terrarium regularly, but avoid using harsh chemicals; remove uneaten food and waste promptly.
Observation: Observe your tarantula's behavior for signs of stress or illness and adapt their care as needed.
