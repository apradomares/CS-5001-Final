Proper Tank Environment: A minimum 5-gallon tank with a filter and heater to maintain stable water conditions; bettas are tropical fish requiring warm water.

Water Quality: Regularly check and maintain water quality; perform partial water changes weekly to keep ammonia and nitrate levels low.

Diet: Feed high-quality betta pellets or flakes designed for bettas; occasionally supplement with live or frozen foods like brine shrimp or bloodworms.

Avoid Overfeeding: Feed small amounts once or twice a day; overfeeding can lead to health issues and water pollution.

Tank Setup: Provide hiding places and non-abrasive plants; bettas enjoy spaces to explore and rest in.

Avoid Strong Currents: Bettas prefer calm water as strong currents can stress them and hinder their swimming.

Isolation: Bettas are territorial and should be kept alone; males especially are prone to fighting with other bettas.

Monitor Health: Watch for signs of stress or illness, such as fading colors, lethargy, or refusal to eat.

Limit Direct Sunlight: Avoid placing the tank in direct sunlight to prevent excessive algae growth and temperature fluctuations.

Regular Observation: Spend time observing your betta to understand its behavior and needs, ensuring a healthy and interactive environment.
