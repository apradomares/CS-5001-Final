Cage Size and Placement: Provide a large cage with horizontal bars for climbing; place it in a quiet, well-lit area away from drafts and extreme temperatures.
Companionship: Parakeets are social birds and often do well in pairs or small groups to prevent loneliness.
Diet: Feed a balanced diet of high-quality seed mix, fresh fruits, and vegetables; avoid avocado and chocolate, which are toxic to birds.
Fresh Water: Always have fresh water available; change it daily to ensure cleanliness and health.
Toys and Stimulation: Provide toys, mirrors, and perches for mental stimulation and physical exercise.
Regular Exercise: Allow supervised out-of-cage time in a safe, enclosed space for exercise and exploration.
Grooming: Trim nails regularly and provide a cuttlebone for beak health; misting or shallow water baths are often enjoyed for feather care.
Health Monitoring: Watch for signs of illness like changes in eating, behavior, or droppings; consult a vet if you notice anything unusual.
Clean Environment: Clean the cage regularly to prevent the buildup of droppings and food waste; maintain good hygiene.
Interaction and Training: Spend time daily interacting with your parakeets; they can be trained to do simple tricks and mimic sounds.
